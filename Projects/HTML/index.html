              "He's Pretty Much Worshipped": Chennai Super Kings Star On MS
              Dhoni's 'Incredible' Stardom
            </h1>
            <p style="border: 5px solid black; color: rgb(59, 57, 57)">
              Chennai Super Kings and New Zealand cricketer Devon Conway opened
              up about the superstardom of MS Dhoni and how he was left stunned
              by the support that the former Indian cricket team skipper enjoys
              during the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023. Dhoni enjoyed a
              massive amount of support at every venue during the
              recently-concluded tournament and he returned the favour by
              leading his side to a record-equalling fifth title. In a recent
              interaction, Conway spoke about his experiences of playing under
              Dhoni and the relationship that the team and players share with
              the CSK captain. “He (Dhoni) is very well-liked in India, he's
              pretty much worshipped there,” Conway said on SENZ Mornings.<br />
              “To see the following and support they have for him is incredible.
              Every away game we had was pretty much a home game because of all
              the supporters travelling to support MS Dhoni.” “It was special –
              a different world than what we're used to.<br /><br />
              I don't think he's able to do much outside the hotel due to his
              fame. He's got the respect of the players,” the Kiwi added. Listen
              to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Conway also spoke about
              the dressing room culture in CSK and head coach Stephen Fleming.
              Conway also spoke about the dressing room culture in CSK and head
              coach Stephen Fleming. “The way he (Fleming) runs the show there,
              he drives a good culture. He's got a good relationship with MS and
              the franchise owners as well. Having his support is very important
              and beneficial for us as a group and individuals,” Conway
              explained when asked about his personal experiences. CSK defeated
              Gujarat Titans by five wickets (DLS) to clinch the IPL 2023
              trophy.

                    India’s top wrestling athletes -- Olympians and world
