# Welcome to Full-Stack Training with JS - Fynd Academy! 😁🍋🔥

Hi! My name is **Abhisek 👀** Computer Science and Engineer and currently Trainee at ***Fynd Academy ✨***, looking to leverage my passion for problem-solving and algorithm design into an engineering role that allows me to create engaging products and user experiences. Skilled in Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I am also a Full-stack Web developer. With excellent communication skills, I am also a great team player and a self-starter that likes to engage in a logical thinking approach to problem-solving.


# Why this repo 😀

This repository contains the daily tasks and projects that I am working on at *Fynd Academy*. The tasks and projects are given by *Richa Arora* Ma'am.

The tasks and projects cover a variety of topics, including:

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   Java Script
-   Node Js 
-   React

The repository is organized by date, with each day's work in its own folder. The folders contain the code, documentation, and any other resources that I used for the work.

I am using this repository to track my progress and to share my work with others.
